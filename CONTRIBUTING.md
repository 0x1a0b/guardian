# Contribute

## Introduction

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to Guardian! It's really great to have people like you in the open source community! ðŸ˜Š

## Steps

-   First Pull Request? Check this out, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
-   Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.
-   The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.
It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you?

### Where to start?
-   Within our code there are various items marked as TODO that may need your attention.
-   Guardian and [Guardian Dashboard](https://github.com/asalih/GuardianUI) needs Postgresql to run so you need to install it on your local environment.
-   [Guardian Dashboard](https://github.com/asalih/GuardianUI) is needed especially for database migrations.
